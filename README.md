# Pacemaker Simulator

There are two tabs to chose from, heart rate simulator and DCM Simulator

## Heart Rate Simulator

This tab lets the user chose a heart rate based on any particular disease listed by the buttons available. Every heart rate will have a different beat pattern so that different tests can be carried out in the DCM simulator

## DCM Simulator

This tab lets the user visualize the previously selected heart rate, while comparing the effect of the pacemaker pacing results.

1. Patient's Heart rate - This is a graph that shows the original heart rate of the patient
2. Paced Heart Rate - This is a graph that shows the paced heart rate

The DCM simulation is started by clicking the button *Heart Rate*. Different modes can be selected based on the operating states selected. This gives availability of modes while restricted others.

*NOTE: * Some of the operating modes will not work for certain heart beats and it will result in a broken paced heart rate graph. This also apply to changing the sensed delay while operating the DCM Simulator.
